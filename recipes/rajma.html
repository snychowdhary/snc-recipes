    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the kidney beans into a large container and cover with several
        inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind the onion, ginger, and garlic into a paste using a mortar and
        pestle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil and ghee together in a pressure cooker over medium heat.
        Fry the red chile peppers, cumin seeds, and whole cloves in the hot oil
        until the cumin seeds begin to splutter; stir the onion paste into the
        mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Season with
        the ground turmeric, ground cumin, and ground coriander; continue
        cooking for a few more seconds before adding the tomatoes. Cook until
        the tomatoes are completely tender.

      <li>
        Add the drained kidney beans to the pressure cooker with enough water to

        cook about 40 minutes. Lower the heat to low and cook another 10 to 15
        minutes. Release the pressure and open the cooker. Stir the garam masala
        and ground red pepper into the bean mixture; garnish with chopped
