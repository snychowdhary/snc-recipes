    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A true French omelette, is just eggs and butter, no filling. The egg is
      folded for a soft, tender texture. It's 10% ingredients and 90% technique,
      so it does take a bit of practice to perfect.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients (Servings: 1)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 fresh eggs</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cold water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, salt, and water together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until
        mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch non-stick skillet over
        medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and before it starts to
        sizzle, pour in the whisked eggs. Stir in a circular pattern with a
        heat-proof spatula, lifting and "scrambling" eggs, shaking pan to keep
        leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring
        until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface of the eggs to
        move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness.
        As soon as surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin rolling
        the omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls until omelette is
        about 2 inches from opposite side of pan. Use spatula to fold the last
        flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam side up. Add
        cubes of the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to pan. Gently push the
        butter as it melts under the omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide omelette to edge of pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam side
        down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You can tuck in the ends, if you
        like. Brush surface with a bit more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
